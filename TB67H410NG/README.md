Documentation and testing of the TB67H410NG motor driver IC

## Results

The TB67H410NG was not effective for high current motor driver applications.  Even when using "large mode" for higher current draw, the voltage drop under load was so large that the motor could never reach maximum speed.  Additionally, the abnormal footprint made it difficult to test without a custom breadboard adapter.
